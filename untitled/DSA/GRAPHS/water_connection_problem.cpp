//PROBLEM STATEMENT:
//Every house in the colony has at most one pipe going into it and at most one pipe going out of it.
//Tanks and taps are to be installed in a manner such that every house with one outgoing pipe
//but no incoming pipe gets a tank installed on its roof and every house with only an incoming pipe and no outgoing pipe gets a tap.
//Given two integers n and p denoting the number of houses and the number of pipes.
//The connections of pipe among the houses contain three input values: ai, bi, di denoting the pipe of diameter di
//from house ai to house bi. Find the efficient way for the construction of the network of pipes.
//The output will contain the number of pairs of tanks and taps t installed in first line and the next t lines contain three integers:
//house number of tank, house number of tap and the minimum diameter of pipe between them.

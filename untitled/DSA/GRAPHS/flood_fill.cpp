/*
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers,
each integer representing the pixel value of the image.
Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill,
and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.
To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel,
plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel,
plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel),
and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

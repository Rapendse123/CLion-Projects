///*
//PROBLEM STATEMENT:
//There are n people standing in a circle (numbered clockwise 1 to n) waiting to be executed.
//The counting begins at point 1 in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction (clockwise).
//In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed.
//The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed),
//until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
//Given the total number of persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth person is killed in circle.
//The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.

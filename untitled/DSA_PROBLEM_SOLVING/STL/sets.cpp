//// sets contain unique objects
//// search,insert and remove have 'constant time complexity'
//// internally organized into buckets
//// it uses hashing to insert elements in buckets
//// this allows fast access to elements as one hash is computed it refers to exact bucket the element is placed into
//// in 'unordered set' insertion and deletion is very faster, it maintains a collection of unique items
